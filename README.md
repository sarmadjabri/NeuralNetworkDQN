# Snake-Game
Recreation of google snake and an algorithm to beat google snake.
Source code is not fully mine as I did get help from numerous websites.

the algorithm to beat snake game is a DQN learning neural network of which plays the game several times and saves its attempts.

the neural network has a high epilison and a decay rate which enables the neural network to slowly exploit more.

In short, this Deep Q neural network has one input layer 2 hidden layers and 1 output layer.
